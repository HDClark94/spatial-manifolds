"""One row per cell: who it is, whether it follows the population, and why.

Usage:  python3 build_unit_table.py [--rebuild]

Figure 2 asks three questions about single units, and each needs a different
source joined onto the same cell:

  WHICH IDENTITIES FOLLOW?   open-field class (grid / non-grid spatial /
                             non-spatial) against the null-corrected agreement
                             with the population anchoring axis
  WHAT DO INTERNEURONS DO?   there is no interneuron label in this dataset, so
                             one is derived from the spike waveform
  WHO DISSENTS, AND WHY?     cells that stay anchored while the population is
                             not, tested against open-field speed modulation

Writes data/population_state/unit_table.csv.

FOUR SOURCES, JOINED ON (mouse, day, cluster_id)

  per_cell_pc1.csv        agreement r with the population axis, recomputed
                          leave-one-out so a cell is not scored against a
                          component it helped define, plus its circular-shift
                          null. `excess = r - r_null` is the comparable quantity.
  labels/M*D*.npz         the per-trial labels themselves, for the dissent
                          measures below, which cannot be read off r
  cell_classifications_v2 open-field identity and anatomy
  clusters .npz metadata  spike waveform, for the interneuron call
  of_speed_score.csv      open-field speed score, COMPUTED (of_speed_score.py),
                          not the supplied time-shifted GLM -- that statistic is
                          negative for almost every cell and reaches
                          significance in ~1% of entorhinal cells, so it has no
                          dynamic range to test anything against. The computed
                          score beats its shift null in ~60% of cells and
                          replicates across OF1/OF2 at r = 0.75.

WHY A DISSENT MEASURE AND NOT JUST r. A cell can disagree with the population in
two different ways and r does not distinguish them: it can be anchored when the
population is not (a dissenter that holds its map), or non-anchored when the
population is (a cell that drops out). Both give a low r. So:

    stay  = P(cell anchored | population NON-anchored)
    drop  = P(cell non-anchored | population anchored)

`stay` is the one the speed hypothesis is about -- a cell that keeps a stable
track map while the population loses one. The two are reported separately
because a single symmetric score would average them into nothing.

THE INTERNEURON CALL IS A GUESS AND IS LABELLED AS ONE. No ground truth exists
here, so putative fast-spiking cells are taken as narrow-waveform AND
high-rate. The threshold is not assumed: `interneuron_threshold()` fits a
two-component Gaussian mixture to log peak-to-trough duration and takes the
crossing point, and the script prints the separation so a reader can see whether
the distribution was bimodal at all. A unimodal distribution would mean the
split is arbitrary, and that has to be visible rather than buried.

OPEN-FIELD SPEED is r(firing rate, running speed) in 200 ms bins over moving
periods, against a circular-shift null. OF1 is preferred where both open-field
sessions exist, with OF2 as the reliability check rather than something to
average in.
